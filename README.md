# scraper is a command line app built with Node.js that goes out to
# http://shirts4mike.com, and brings back information about todays shirts.
# Then scraper writes the information to a .csv file, named for todays date
# and stores it in a sub-folder called data. If no such folder exists, scraper
# will create one.
